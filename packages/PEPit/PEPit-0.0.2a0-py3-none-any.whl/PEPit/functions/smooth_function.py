class SmoothFunction(Function):
    """
    The :class:`SmoothFunction` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    implementing the interpolation constraints of the class of smooth (not necessarily convex) functions.

    Attributes:
        L (float): smoothness parameter

    Smooth functions are characterized by the smoothness parameter `L`, hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=SmoothFunction, param={'L': 1})
