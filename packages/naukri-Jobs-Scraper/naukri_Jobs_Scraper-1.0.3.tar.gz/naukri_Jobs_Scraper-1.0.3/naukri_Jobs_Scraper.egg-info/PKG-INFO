#### BotStudio
For this project, we implemented an automated browser that scrapes search results from Naukri.com. [Bot Studio](https://pypi.org/project/botstudio/) is needed for browser automation. As soon as we import the library in code, an automated browser will open up and it will open Naukri.com and searches for location and skills which we gave as input, and scrapes Experience, Salary, Job Location, Role, Industry Typeâ€¦..
