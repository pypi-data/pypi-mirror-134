# plover-tapey-tape

`plover-tapey-tape` is an alternative to Plover’s built-in paper tape.
It provides a side-by-side view of strokes and translations as well as
extra information such as bars to the left representing how long each
stroke took.

```

```

As you write, the paper tape is written in real time to a file named
`tapey_tape.txt` in Plover’s configuration directory:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\plover`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/plover`
- Linux: `~/.config/plover`

You can review the file afterwards or use a tool like `tail -f` to
get a real-time feed.

## Configuration

To configure this plugin, create a JSON file named `tapey_tape.json`
in Plover’s configuration directory (see above). The available options
are as follows:

- `bar_time_unit`: The amount of time in seconds each `+` sign represents.
  Defaults to `0.2`.
- `bar_max_width`: The maximum number of `+` signs shown. Set this to `0`
  to hide the bars. Defaults to `5`.

For example, to stretch out the bars to twice the default width,
you can use

```json
{
    "bar_time_unit": 0.1,
    "bar_max_width": 10
}
```
