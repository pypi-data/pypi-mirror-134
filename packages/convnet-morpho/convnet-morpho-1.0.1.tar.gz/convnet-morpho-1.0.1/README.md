This toolkit includes functions to read and process cell segmentations that are made either from automatic or manual segmentations. It also includes a deep-learning based morphology analysis library - which is based on the convolutional neural network AlexNet for image feature extraction. Finally it contains feature aggregation, dimensionality reduction and visualization, and a module for joint analysis of morphology and gene expression.

Convnet.morpho is written in Python 3.
