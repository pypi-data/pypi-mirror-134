It includes functions to read and process cell segmentations, that are made either from automatic or manual segmentations. It also includes a deep-learning based morphology analysis library - for this it uses the convolutional neural network AlexNet for image feature extraction. Finally it contains feature aggregation, dimensionality reduction and visualization, and a module for integrative and joint analysis of morphology and gene expression.
