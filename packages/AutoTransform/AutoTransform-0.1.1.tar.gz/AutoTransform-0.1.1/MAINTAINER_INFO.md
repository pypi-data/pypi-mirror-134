### Merging Pull Requests/Features

When a new feature/pull request is merged in to master, always merge with `--no-ff` to preserve feature history. Additionally, the commit that merges the feature should update the changelog for the upcomming release so no features are missed or have to be added later. If possible include links to the associated pull request/issue/etc... with the changelog.

If an upgrade package is associated with a change, include information for downloading the package in the changelog so that bespoke deployments can more readily move to new releases.
