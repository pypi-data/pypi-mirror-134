Welcome to MT Metadata documentation!
======================================

MT Metadata is meant to be a tool to standardize both time series and transfer function metadata for magnetotelluric data.

The base metadata object is structured in a flexible way to accommodate any type of metadata, you just need to formulate the standards following the format described in the documentation.  See :ref:`structure` and :ref:`ref-usage` for more details.
