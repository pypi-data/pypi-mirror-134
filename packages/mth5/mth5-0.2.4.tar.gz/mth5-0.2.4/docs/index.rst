MTH5 is an HDF5 data container for magnetotelluric time series data, but could be extended to other data types.  This package provides tools for reading/writing/manipulating MTH5 files.

MTH5 uses `h5py <https://www.h5py.org/>`__  to interact with the HDF5 file, `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`__ to interact with the data in a nice way, and all metadata use `mt_metadata <https://github.com/kujaku11/mt_metadata>`__. 

This project is in cooperation with the Incorporated Research Institutes of Seismology, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other collaborators.  Facilities of the IRIS Consortium are supported by the National Science Foundationâ€™s Seismological Facilities for the Advancement of Geoscience (SAGE) Award under Cooperative Support Agreement EAR-1851048.  USGS is partially funded through the Community for Data Integration and IMAGe through the Minerals Resources Program.
