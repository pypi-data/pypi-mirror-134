The goal of MTH5 is to develop an archivable and exchangeable format for magnetotelluric time series data.  MTH5 provides tools to read/write MTH5 files and tools to interact with MTH5 files.  All metadata is based on the `mt_metadata <https://github.com/kujaku11/mt_metadata>`_   


* Version: 0.2.4
* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://mth5.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Read and write HDF5 files formated for magnetotelluric time series.
* From MTH5 a user can create an MTH5 file, get/add/remove stations, runs, channels and filters and all associated metadata.
* Data is contained as an `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html>`_ which can house the data and metadata together, and data is indexed by time.
* Readers for some data types are included as plugins, namely
	- Z3D
	- NIMS BIN
	- USGS ASCII
	- StationXML + miniseed
