# For non-commercial use:

For non-commercial use, feel free to use this software or modify it for any purpose.

But if you do, you must:

    1. Include it with a compatible ('copyleft') license,

    2. Distribute the original source code, plus any modifications you make to
       this code.

    3. Make this clear in the credits of your product and source code, and also
       make sure it's clear how to get the original code, and also make sure it's
       clear how to get the modified code (if you have modifications.)
    
I would also kindly ask you to:

    1. Tell me about your project, because if this code becomes useful or
       interesting in any way, I'd really like to know. Because, to me, this is
       a totally useless project.
    
    2. Read GPL-v3 (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), just for fun.


# For commercial use:

For any commercial, profitable, or professional use:

    1. Give me $5 USD.
    
    2. If you make over $200,000 a year, or you are part of a company that makes
       over $500,00 a year, give me $1000 USD, thankyouverymuch.
       
    3. If you're a company that partners with Government immigration enforcement
       (say, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement), and you use this
       code for a product (say, an AI coding partner), then you must give me
       $200000, thankyouverymuch.

# For people who actually want to use this commercially but don't like this license:

I wrote this code and license to make my friends laugh, but I'd never turn down
a good business opportunity. So, if you have a legitimate business interest or
use case and actually want to use this, then let me know! This code is extra
ordinarily useless so I'd be particularly interested in knowing how you're 
using this to make money.

(I'd also be interested in money.)

Oh, this part is important if I want to do business: I (Lynn Pepin) reserve the
right to change this license for any reason, say, to make cool business deals.
