A toolbox for benchmarking reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms on building energy optimisation (BEO) problems. Beobench does not replace existing libraries defining BEO problems (such as `BOPTEST <https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest>`_) — instead it makes working with them easier.

Features
--------

- *Wide range of RL algorithms:* test the most common RL algorithms on BEO problems without re-implementing by using beobench's `Ray RLlib <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib>`_ integration.
- *Experiment logging:* log experiment results in a reproducible and sharable manner via `Weights and Biases`_.
- *Hyperparameter tuning:* easily tune hyperparameters using the extensive `Ray Tune syntax <https://docs.ray.io/en/master/tune/index.html>`_.
- *Installers:* avoid having to manage messy Python namespaces yourself — just install beobench via pip and use its pre-configured docker containers to take care of managing other BEO packages and their dependencies.
