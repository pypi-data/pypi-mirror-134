# thoughtforge-client
Client SDK for ThoughtForge AI


## Installation instructions:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:thoughtforge-ai/thoughtforge-client.git thoughtforge_client`

Note: Python has difficulty with root directories that contain dashes, so it's important to put into a folder named thoughtforge_client (or some other python-module-safe name

2. cd thoughtforge_client

3. pip install -r requirements.txt

4. set THOUGHTFORGE_API_KEY environment variable to your API key

5. set environment variables

THOUGHTFORGE_HOST='core.tf-api.com'

THOUGHTFORGE_PORT=443

(optionally, the client makes use of python-dotenv, and you can place your environment variables in a .env file)
