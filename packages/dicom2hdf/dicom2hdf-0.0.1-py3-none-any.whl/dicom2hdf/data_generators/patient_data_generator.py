    @Description:       This file contains the PatientDataGenerator class which is used to iterate on multiple
                        patients' dicom files and segmentation files using the PatientDataReader to obtain all patients'
                        data. The PatientDataGenerator inherits from the Generator abstract class.

        paths_to_patients_folder_and_segmentations : List[PathsToPatientFolderAndSegmentations]
            List of named tuples including the path to the folder containing the patient dicom files and the path to

        organs : Optional[Union[str, Dict[str, List[str]], None]], default = None.
            A dictionary that contains the organs and their associated segment names. Keys are arbitrary organ names
            and values are lists of possible segment names. It can also be specified as a path to a json file that
            contains the organs dictionary.
        series_descriptions : Optional[Union[str, Dict[str, List[str]], None]], default = None.
            A dictionary that contains the series descriptions of the images that absolutely needs to be extracted from
            the patient's file. Keys are arbitrary names given to the images we want to add and values are lists of
            series descriptions. The images associated with these series descriptions do not need to have a
            corresponding segmentation. In fact, the whole point of adding a way to specify the series descriptions that
            must be added to the dataset is to be able to add images without their segmentation. Can be specified as a
            path to a json file that contains the series descriptions dictionary.
