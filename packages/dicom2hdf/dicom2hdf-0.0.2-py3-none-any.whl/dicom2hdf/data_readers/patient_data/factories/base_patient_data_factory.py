        Parameters
        ----------
        images_data : List[ImageDataModel]
            A list of the patient's images data.
        organs : Dict[str, List[str]]
            A dictionary that contains the organs and their associated segment names. Keys are arbitrary organ names
            and values are lists of possible segment names.
        paths_to_segmentations : Optional[List[str]]
            A list of paths to the segmentation files. The name of the segmentation files must include the series uid
            of their corresponding image, i.e. the image on which the segmentation was made.
        series_descriptions : Optional[Dict[str, List[str]]]
            A dictionary that contains the series descriptions of the images that absolutely needs to be extracted from
            the patient's file. Keys are arbitrary names given to the images we want to add and values are lists of
            series descriptions. The images associated with these series descriptions do not need to have a
            corresponding segmentation. In fact, the whole point of adding a way to specify the series descriptions that
            must be added to the dataset is to be able to add images without segmentation.
