# sfe

#### Description
Sfe is a Python software based on finite element theory. Using object-oriented programming makes it easier for people to understand. The finite element method is a powerful numerical method. It supports the calculation of statics and dyna- mics, the division of elements is clearer, and a variety of beam theory is added. Unique analysis of aeronautical blades with nonlinear friction.

#### Software Architecture
The framework is divided into six parts: nodes, cells, cell types, computational sets, solvers and graphing tools.

#### Installation

1.  Python installation, version 3 or later.
2.  You need numpy, scipy, matplotlib.
3.  pip install sfe.

#### Directions for use

1.  Import the SFE package.
2.  Input existing data.
3.  The node coordinates are established using the Node class.
4.  The element is created by connecting nodes with the Element class.
5.  Select all element types in the library to establish unique element.
6.  Use the solver.
7.  Get the required data in the interaction window or in the variable manager.

#### Applications

1.  Analysis and calculation for aero engine blade.
2.  In view of the practical problems analyzed by beam theory.
3.  Structural problems solved by finite element method.
