John,

Natasha wasn't done with the listings copy, so I've worked on a test file instead. If it will help you work the bugs out, it is here. If not, I hope we'll have final copy this afternoon. 

In this folder:
G:\Alltrans\to-johnb\TheCrucibleListings

I've provided a TEST export. Hopefully the final export will be ready this afternoon. 
TEST export for processing Crucible.csv

This is the stylesheets document, with an example of how the text needs to be styled and the order of the text:
CRUCIBLE-Stylesheets.docx

This is the example of what the final design will look like:
CRUCIBLE-Design.pdf


Instructions for you 
This time, you need to pull out the PREREQUISITE copy
Search for the word "PREREQUISITE" in the description field, and pull it and everything after it until the end of the description out and into a separate field. 
Make the word 'PREREQUISITE' lower case. 
Leave the case alone on the rest of the copy in this prerequisite field. 
It will be tagged with the "prerequisite' style

When they run the formatting script NEXT year, they will have the prerequisite separated out into its own field.


OTHER NOTES

Department is a sort field that only displays once, at beginning of department.
File has already been sorted (Sort: 1) Section; 2) Department; 3) ClassName)
