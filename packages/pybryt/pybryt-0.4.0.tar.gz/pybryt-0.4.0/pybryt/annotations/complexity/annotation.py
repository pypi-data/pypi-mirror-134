    Abstract base class for annotations that assert a condition on the complexity of a student's code.

    takes in a complexity class and any necessary keyword arguments. Note that all compelxity
    annotations require a ``name`` keyword argument so that they can be matched with their results
    from the student's memory footprint.

            being asserted

    :py:obj:`check_time_complexity<pybryt.check_time_complexity>` context manager to check time
    complexity in student's code. The ``name`` of this annotation should be the same as the ``name``

        Finds all instances of the :py:class:`TimeComplexityResult<pybryt.execution.TimeComplexityResult>`
