Flipkart product scraper is a python library to scrape for a flipkart product using browser automation. 
It currently runs only on windows.

### Example
In this example we first import library, then we provide the keyword to be scraped instead of "clothes".
```sh
from flipkart_product_scraper import *
response = flipkart.product_scraper(search="clothes")
#response = {
#  "body": [
#    {
#      "Link":"/idisi-clothes-polycotton-printed-shirt-fabric/p/itmcf8133404aff4?pid=FABGA864JWDFRZXH&lid=LSTFABGA864JWDFRZXHINYCFJ&marketplace=FLIPKART...",
#      "Price": "â‚¹289",
#      "Title": "Polycotton Printed Shirt Fabric"
#    },....]}

```
