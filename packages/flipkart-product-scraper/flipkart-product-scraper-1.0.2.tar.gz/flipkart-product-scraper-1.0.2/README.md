Flipkart product scraper is a python library to scrape for a Flipkart product using browser automation. 
It currently runs only on windows.

### Scrape Title, Price and Link of Flipkart Product
We first import library, then we provide the keyword to be scraped instead of **"clothes"**.
```sh
from flipkart_product_scraper import *
response=flipkart.product_data(keyword="clothes")
```

### Response Data
```json
      "Link":"/idisi-clothes-polycotton-printed-shirt-fabric/p/itmcf8133404aff4?pid=FABGA864JWDFRZXH&lid=LSTFABGA864JWDFRZXHINYCFJ&marketplace=FLIPKART...",
      "Price": "â‚¹289",
      "Title": "Polycotton Printed Shirt Fabric"
```

#### BotStudio
