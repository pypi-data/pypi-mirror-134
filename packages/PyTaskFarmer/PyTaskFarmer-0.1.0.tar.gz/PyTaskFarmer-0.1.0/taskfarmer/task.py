    Abstract definition of a task list.

    A task list keeps track of available tasks in a process-safe manner.

    A task can either be unprocessed (aka `toprocess`) or completed
    (aka `done`). It is referred to by a task ID.

    There are no official requirements on what a task is. However most runners
    expect it to be a command that can be executed.

    The path containing the definition of tasks is provided to the constructor. It
    is up to the implementation to parse it.

    A work directory is provided that stores the progress and log files for a
    given run over the tasklist.

    The `workdir` also contains a `lock` file. The `flock` status of this file 
    controls exclusive access to all work files. This is handled by the `lock`/`unlock`
    functions. If the filesystem does not support file locking, an alternate path
    can be used via a global `lock_area` variable. In this case, the `lock` path
    becomes `lock_area/md5(absolute path of workdir)_lock`.

    All functions defined in this class should be implemented in
    subclasses.

    A list of tasks is defined using a file containing a task per line, with

    Subclasses can implement the :code:`__getitem__` function to futher modify
    the task definitions. The original line/task content is stored in the
    `tasks` member variable. By default, the `tasks[taskid]` is returned
