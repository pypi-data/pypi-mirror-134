"""
android constants and helper functions
======================================

to include this ae namespace portion into your project add the following import statement into your main module
(main.py) of your application project::

    import ae.droid

this import will ensure that all your permissions will be requested on app startup. on other platforms than Android it
will have no effect.

big thanks to `Robert Flatt <https://github.com/RobertFlatt>`_ for his investigations, findings and documentations to
code and build Kivy apps for the Android OS, and to `Gabriel Pettier <https://github.com/tshirtman>`_ for his service
osc example.
