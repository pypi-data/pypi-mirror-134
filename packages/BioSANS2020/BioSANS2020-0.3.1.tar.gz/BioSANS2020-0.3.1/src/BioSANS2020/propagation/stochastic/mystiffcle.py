"""

                  This module is the mystiffcle module

This can propagate non-stiff to moderately stiff stochastic simulation
using the chemical langevine equation. Here two versions are provided

1) Tau-adaptive CLE
2) Fix-inreval CLE

The following are the list of function for this module.

1. cle_model
2. cle_calculate
3. cle2_calculate
