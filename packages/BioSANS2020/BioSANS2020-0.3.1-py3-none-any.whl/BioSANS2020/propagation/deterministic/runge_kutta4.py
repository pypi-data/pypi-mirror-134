    Args:
        tvar (list): time stamp of trajectories i.e. [0, 0.1, 0.2, ...]
        sp_comp (dict): dictionary of appearance or position of species
            or component in the reaction tag of BioSANS topology file.

            For example;

                #REACTIONS
                A => B, -kf1    # negative means to be estimated
                B => C, kf2

            The value of sp_comp is

                sp_comp = {'A': {0}, 'B': {0, 1}, 'C': {1}}

                A appears in first reaction with index 0
                B appears in first and second reaction with index 0, 1
                C appears in second reaction with index 1
        ks_dict (dict): dictionary of rate constant that appears in each
            reactions.

            For example;

                #REACTIONS
                A => B , 0.3        # first reaction
                B <=> C, 0.1, 0.2   # second reaction

                }
        conc (dict): dictionary of initial concentration.

            For example;

                {'A': 100.0, 'B': -1.0, 'C': 0.0}
                negative means unknown or for estimation
        r_dict (dict): dictionary of reactant stoichiometry. For example

            r_dict = {
                0: {'A': 1},  # first reaction, coefficient of A is 1
                1: {'B': 1}   # second reaction, coefficient of B is 1
            }
        p_dict (dict): dictionary of product stoichiometry. For example

            p_dict = {
                0: {'B': 1},  # first reaction, coefficient of B is 1
                1: {'C': 1}   # second reaction, coefficient of C is 1
            }
        stch_var (numpy.ndarray): stoichiometric matrix. For example

            v_stoich = np.array([
                [   -1,           0   ]            # species A
                [    1,          -1   ]            # species B
                [    0,           1   ]            # species C
                  #1st rxn    2nd rxn
            ])
        yscal (int, optional): [description]. Defaults to 10.
        molar (bool, optional): If True, the units for any amount is in
            molar. Propensity will be macroscopic. Defaults to False.
        implicit (bool, optional): True means report in time intervals
            similar to the input time intervals even if actual step is
            more or less. Defaults to False.
        rfile (string, optional): name of topology file where some
            parameters or components are negative indicating  they  have
            to be estimated. Defaults to None.
