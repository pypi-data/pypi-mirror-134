"""

             This module is the lna_function_of_time module

     This module performs numerical propagation of linear noise approxi-
mation or LNA by exploiting the following relationship.

                   dC/dt = AC + CA.T + BB

where A is defined as d(S*f)/dx where S is the stoichiometric  matrix, f
are the propensities or fluxes, and x are the components or species. The
flux is a function of species x and rate constant k. BB is the diffusion
matrix equivalent to S*diag(f)*S.T where diag(f) is a square matrix with
zero non-diagonal elements and f[i] in each diagonal elements. C is the
covariance matrix and t is time.

The following are the list of function for this module.
