"""

                     This is the lna_approx module

     This module performs numerical linear noise approximation or LNA by
exploiting the following relationship.

                         AC + CA.T + BB = 0

where A is defined as d(S*f)/dx where S is the stoichiometric  matrix, f
are the propensities or fluxes, and x are the components or species. The
flux is a function of  x and rate constant k. BB is the diffusion matrix
equivalent  to S*diag(f)*S.T where diag(f) is a  square matrix with zero
non-diagonal elements and f[i] in each diagonal elements.

The following are the list of function for this module.

1. rem_rowcol_zero
2. lna_ss_jacobian
3. lna_model_ss
4. lna_steady_state
