                    This is the euler_mod module

The main  task  this module  do is to  integrate  ordinary  differential
equation (ODE)  using the Euler method. In  this module, two implementa-
tion is provided. Both are tau-adaptive.

The list of functions in this module are as follows;

1. euler_model
2. euler_int

        items (list, optional): 3 item list of [canvas, scroll_x,
            scroll_y], Defaults to None.
        implicit (bool, optional): True means report in time intervals
            similar to the input time intervals even if actual step is
            more or less. Defaults to False.
        molar (bool, optional): True if concentration or amount is in
            molar and you want to use macroscopic equations otherwise it
            should be False and using microscopic equations. Defaults to
            False.
