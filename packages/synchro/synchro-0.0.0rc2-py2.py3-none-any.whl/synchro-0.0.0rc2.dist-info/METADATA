# synchro
Customisable file transfers using rsync

---

## To install
To install, you need a Unix-based system with conda (miniconda or anaconda) installed.

```bash
conda create --name synchro python=3.9
conda activate synchro
pip install synchro
```

If you don't have rsync installed, you will need to do so. E.g. on macOS 
it can be installed with homebrew:
```bash
brew install rsync
```

## To use
`synchro` has two modes of use on the command line, either with flags, or a config file.

### Command line flags
**Not yet implemented**


### Config file
The only input is the path to a source directory (the one being transferred).
```bash
synchro /path/to/source_directory
```

This source directory must contain a `file_transfers.conf` file which contains the 
information needed for the transfer.
```text
destination = /path/to/destination_directory # Where to move the data to
untar = y # Untar the data after copying?
create_dest = y # Create the destination directory if it doesn't exist?
transfer_ready_file = ready.txt # Not yet implemented
```

N.B. the destination can also be on a remote host (an ssh key must be set up), e.g.:
```text
destination = user@IP:/path/to/destination_directory
```
