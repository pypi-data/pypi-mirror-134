    """Base class for all layers.

    Every layer should inherit from this class and implement the abstract methods. A layer is a part of a neural network
    that performs some computation on the input data and produces an output. The output of a layer is the input of the
    next layer. Some layers have weights and biases, which are used to compute the output. These parameters are
    updated during training using backpropagation. This is the reason why there are methods to compute the gradient of
    the loss function with respect to the input of the layer, the weights and the biases. The gradient of the loss
    with respect to the weights and biases is computed in the `update` method.

    Args:
        input_shape (tuple or None): Shape of the input.
        output_shape (tuple): Shape of the output.
        activation (str): Activation function to use.
        name (str): Name of the layer.
        trainable (bool): Whether the layer is trainable.
        has_weights (bool): Whether the layer has weights.

    Attributes:
        input_shape (tuple or None): Shape of the input.
        output_shape (tuple): Shape of the output.
        name (str): Name of the layer. The name is used to identify the layer in the network
            and is used by the optimizer to identify the layer's parameters.
        weights (np.ndarray): Weights of the layer (None by default). If the layer has weights,
            they can be set using the set_weights method or in the initialize method.
        bias (np.ndarray): Bias of the layer (None by default). They are set in the
            initialize method or in the set_weights method.
        has_weights (bool): Whether the layer has weights.
        trainable (bool): Whether the layer is trainable.
        initialized (bool): Whether the layer has been initialized.
        activation (ActivationFunction): Activation function to use.
        inputs (np.ndarray): Inputs of the layer. Needed in the backward pass.
        outputs (np.ndarray): Outputs of the layer before the activation. Needed in the backward pass.
