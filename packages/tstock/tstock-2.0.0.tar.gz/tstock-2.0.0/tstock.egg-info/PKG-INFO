# Dependencies

- cURL. That's it. Just make sure it's installed on your system.

# Installation

### AUR

`tstock` is available on the AUR. If you are on an Archlinux system, you can just install it using your AUR helper. Example using `yay`:

```
yay -S tstock
```

### Installing from source

git clone https://github.com/Gbox4/tstock.git
cd tstock

```

# Getting started

### MarketStack API setup

After installing `tstock`, you will need a MarketStack API key to pull the market data.

- Make a free MarketStack API account at https://marketstack.com/signup/free
- Login and find your API Access Key on the Dashboard page
- Run `export MARKETSTACK_API_KEY=<your access key>`. You can make this permanent by adding that command to your `.bashrc`.

### Usage

Run `./tstock TICKER` to get the 3 month chart of `$TICKER`. Use `-d DAYS` to specify the number of days back you want to pull. Use `-y LINES` to specify the length of the chart's y axis.

You can get indexes by appending `.INDX`. for example, `./tstock DJI.INDX` to get the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Find more information on how to specify special tickers on MarketWatch's API Docs: https://marketstack.com/documentation

# Notes

- The free tier of the API is limited to 100 API calls per month.
