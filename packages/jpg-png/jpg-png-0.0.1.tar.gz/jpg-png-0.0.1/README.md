# JPG_to_PNG_converter
### **This program will change picture format from JPG to PNG** 

## How to use it?
The program will first ask user to insert the **folder name** in which **.jpg** images are present. The user simply provide the name of the folder.
If the folder is not present in the current directory, it will show a message saying "**No folder named** <folder_name> **exist**".


If the user provides correct folder name, it will then ask user to input the name of the folder in which he/she wants to save the converted .png images.
If this folder already exists, it will save all the converted images in the that folder. Whereas if the folder does not exist, it will first create a folder and then will save all the converted images in the png formate.
