# Admission Prediction Model

This project is a basic implementation for a Machine Learning model to predict Graduate (or Master's) admissions based on factors such as, GRE Score, TOEFL Score, CGPA, etc. .

The main purpose of this package is to facilitate the deployment of a Regression model which was experimented on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions">this dataset</a>.

In this repository, you can find the basic files for creating and installing the package on your own. This also includes the pytest module which I have used to run some basic validation tests.
