## Installation

Full installation:

```bash
pip install gurun[full]
```

Installing only the main framework components:

```bash
pip install gurun
```

You can also install component dependencies separately. Thus, we have the cv (computer vision) version and the gui version:

```bash
pip install gurun[cv] 
pip install gurun[gui]
```

## Development
### Setting up a development environment

If you don't have a local development environment, you can follow these steps to set one up.

First, if you have not already, install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Now, initialize poetry and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks:

```bash
make install && make install-pre-commit
```

### Running tests

You can run the tests with:

```bash
make tests
```

This will run the tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and show information about the coverage.

### Formatting the code

To format the code, you can use the command:

```bash
make formatting
```

This will run the [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) and )[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) commands.

If you want to just check the formatting, use the command:

```bash
make check-formatting
```

### Releasing a new version

To release a new version, you need to follow these steps:

1. Update the version with `poetry version <version>` and commit the changes. This project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), so the version number should follow the format `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. Alternatively, you can also use the version as `major` or `minor` or `patch`, and the version number will be automatically incremented.

2. Create a Github release with the new version number.

3. (Optional) Publish the new version to PyPI with `poetry publish --build`.
