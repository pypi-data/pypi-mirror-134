The package `ghproject` is a tool for uploading project boards to GitHub filled with labelled issues. This has been created to aid project management in research software projects on GitHub. 

**Possible use cases:**
* Create an onboarding project board for new team members
* Create a project board for developing FAIR research software


Navigate to [API documentation](https://mwakok.github.io/ghproject/ghproject.html) for more detailed and structured information.

## Documentation for users

### Installation

I recommend installing the tool inside a conda environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwakok/ghproject.git
cd ghproject
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate env_ghproject
pip install .
```

Using `ghproject` requires a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT), which can be created via your [GitHub settings](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). To prevent hardcoding of any access tokens, it's a best practice to keep your GitHub PAT as a local environment variable. By default, the package will inspect the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the argument `--token`.

To set up the Token called `GITHUB_TOKEN` for Windows, execute in a terminal:
```bash
setx GITHUB_TOKEN <token> 
```

You might need to restart your terminal/IDE for the changes to take effect.


### Usage

The tool can be used both from the command line and from a Python interpretor, e.g. a Jupyter notebook. We take as an example the following use case in which we want to upload a project board with accompanying issues. Issues are generated from markdown files that need to contain a header with the issue title and associated labels (as a list of strings). 

```yml
---
title: Create FAIR software checklist
labels: ["documentation", "feature"]
---
```

The issue body is then created from the following markdown text. Examples of issues can be found in the folder `/md_files` in the repository.

You can call the module to upload a new project to a GitHub reposotory from the command line. Use to following command to view the help file:

```bash
python -m  ghproject.upload_project -h
```

For example, the following command will create the project board "My project" in the repository "my_repository" and add the issues generated from the markdown files in the relative folder "/md_files":

```bash
python -m ghproject.upload_project --repo "my_repository" --owner "username" --path "./md_files" --project "My project"
```

The various functions can also be accessed directly from the GitHubAPI class. Example usage would be:

```python
import os
from ghproject import GitHubAPI

# Setup arguments
repo_name = "my_repository"
repo_owner = "username" # Github user name or organization name
token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
path_issues = "./md_files"
project_name = "My project"

repo = GitHubAPI(repo_name, repo_owner, token)
repo.load_markdown_files(path_issues)
repo.push_project(project_name)
repo.push_issues()
repo.add_issues_to_project(project_name)
```
