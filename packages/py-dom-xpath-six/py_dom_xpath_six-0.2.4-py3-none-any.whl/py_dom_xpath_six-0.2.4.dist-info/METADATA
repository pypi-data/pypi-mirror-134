py-dom-xpath is a pure Python implementation of XPath 1.0. It
supports almost all XPath 1.0, with the main exception being the
namespace axis. It operates on DOM 2.0 nodes, and works well with
xml.dom.minidom, but also with other xml.dom implementations.

py-dom-xpath-six is a version of py-dom-xpath that is compatible with Python
3.6 and later. It is a fork of py-dom-xpath-redux, which in turn is a fork of
the original py-dom-xpath.

Changes in 0.2.4:
- Fix compatibility issue with Python 3
- Got rid of Python 2 support
- Minor changes to update to newer standards for pypi, etc.

Changes in 0.2.3:
- Optimized sorting of nodesets in document order: do only at end of expression.

py-dom-xpath requires Python 2.5 or greater.

py-dom-xpath uses the Yapps 2 parser generator by Amit J. Patel.
Portions of of Yapps 2 are included in this distribution, to avoid
introducing external dependencies.
