## Typing stubs for requests

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `requests` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `requests`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/requests. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `6907d7f7c6c2aca7d1653e524ac4f690d47feb1b`.
