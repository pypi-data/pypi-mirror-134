This day marks paNDit exodus day.  Merits reflection by people of all religions.

Ethnic cleansing of Kashmir's Hindus began. Didn't stop until  300k–600k were made chased, killed and their properties looted or destroyed by their "peaceful" neighbours & even friends. Many Kashmiri Hindu women were kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered (eg. by beating, cutting at saw mill), throughout the time of exodus. 

It was preceded by slaughter of 300 Hindu men and women, nearly all of them Kashmiri Pandits since the brutal murder of Pandit Tika Lal Taploo, newspaper messages (eg Aftab Jan 4) threatening all Hindus to leave, posters threatening kAshmIris to follow Islamic rules, coloring shops green. 

At midnight (beginning of 19th), a blackout took place in the Kashmir Valley where electricity was cut except in mosques. Throughout the day, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front and Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists use public address systems at mosques to exhort people to defy curfew and take to the streets. Masked men, firing guns, march up and down, terrorizing cowering Pandits who, by then, have locked themselves in their homes.  Three taped slogans are repeatedly played the whole night from mosques: 'Kashmir mei agar rehna hai, Allah-O-Akbar kehna hai' (If you want to stay in Kashmir, you have to say Allah-O-Akbar); 'Yahan kya chalega, Nizam-e-Mustafa' (What do we want here? Rule of Shariah); 'Asi gachchi Pakistan, baTao roas te baTanev san' (We want Pakistan along with Hindu women but without their men).
