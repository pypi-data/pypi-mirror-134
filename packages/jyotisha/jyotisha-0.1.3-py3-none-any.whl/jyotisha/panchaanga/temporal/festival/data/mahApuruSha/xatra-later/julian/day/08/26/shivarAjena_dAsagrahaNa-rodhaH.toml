Shivaji declared to the Dutch: 

> In the days of the Moorish [Muslim] government it was allowed for you to buy male slaves and female slaves here [the Karnatak], and to transport the same, without anyone preventing that. But now you may not, as long as I am master of these lands, buy male or female slaves, nor transport them. And in case you were to do the same, and would want to bring [slaves] aboard, my men will oppose that and prevent it in all ways, and also not allow that they may be brought back in your house; this you must observe and comply with.
