Description: # Sportyfin
        
        ## Description
        
        Stream sports events straight from your Jellyfin server. Sportyfin allows users to scrape for live
        streamed events and watch straight from Jellyfin. Sportyfin also generates meta-data that is used
        in Jellyfin to provide a great viewing experience.
        
        Currently, Sportyfin supports NBA, NHL and NFL livestreams, but we plan to support other leagues in the future.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install Sportyfin with your running instance of Jellyfin, follow the steps bellow:
        
        
        ```bash
        pip install sportyfin --no-binary=sportyfin
        ```
        
        To uninstall the program:
        
        ```bash
        pip uninstall sportyfin
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        We highly recommend running Sportyfin in combination with [tmux](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html), or something similar.
        
        Example usage:
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m sportyfin #arguments
        ```
        
        Start the sportyfin server as follows:
        ```bash
        # -nba specifies finding streams for the NBA
        # -s allows sportyfin to use Selenium to scrape
        # -v enables verbose mode
        # -o enables selecting output location
        
        python3 -m sportyfin -nba -s -v -o ~/Desktop
        ```
        
        ```bash
        # -vv specifies silent mode (no output will be produced)
        # -a specifies all leagues supported by sportyfin
        
        python3 -m sportyfin -a -vv
        ```
        
        Once you have run the program, make sure to link to the .m3u's in the Jellyfin dashboard:
        
        `Dashboard > Live TV > Tuner Devices (+) > Tuner Type (M3U Tuner) > File or URL (enter path)`
        
        Once the path has been defined, you can check out your streams under:
        
        `Home > Live TV > Channels (at the top)`
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Find all the documentation [here]() (will update link with documentation once it is finished).
        
        ## Future Improvement
        
        Add server functionality, aka, ability to access streams (m3u files) from HTTP server.
