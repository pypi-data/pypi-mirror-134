Description: # sky-bkg
        
        ## Description
        
        Two sources of sky background are considered: 
        * Zodiacal light 
        * Earth shine
        
        
        ### Zodiacal light
        Zodiacal light varies as a function of angular distance of the 
        target from the Sun and from the ecliptic. We adopt data in Leinert
        et al. (1998). 
        
        
        ### Earth-shine
        Earth-shine varies strongly as a function of angle between the target
        and the Earth lime. We adopt data from Figure 9.1 in HST/WFC3 instrument 
        handbook. 
        
        ## Installation
        via pip:
        
            pip install sky-bkg
        
        
        ## Usage
        
            from sky_bkg import sky_bkg
            
            ra = 150
            dec = 45
            time = '2019-07-01'
            zodi_wave, zodi_flux = sky_bkg.zodiacal(ra, dec, time)
            
            theta = 40
            earth_wave, earth_flux = sky_bkg.earthshine(theta)
