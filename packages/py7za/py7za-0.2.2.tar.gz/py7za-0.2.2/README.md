# Py7za ("pizza")

Python wrapper for running the 7za.exe utility from https://www.7-zip.org/

The wrapper simply runs the application in a separate process and provides the following added functionality:
- capture and parse output (overriding any `-bs_` arguments)
- track progress and some basic metrics (size, files processed, etc.)

Other than providing that utility, the wrapper tries to provide users access to 7za in a way as simple, and as close to the original as possible. See some documentation for the command line options here https://sevenzip.osdn.jp/chm/cmdline/index.htm (no affiliation).

Additionally, the package contains the `AsyncIOPool` class, which allows you to queue up a large number of asynchronous tasks, and it will keep a certain number of them running at all times, until all tasks are done. This works for any `asyncio` `Task`, but can be handily combined with `Py7za` (see below).

Finally, a command line utility `py7za-box` ("pizza box") is included, which allows you to quickly replace individual files with their zipped equivalent in-place and vice versa, without writing any code. The idea is that a user may want to zip many files in a large project, without removing them from their original location, and still be able to find them by name and easily extract them individually.

## Install

Install the package for use from scripts:
```commandline
pip install py7za
```

Of if you want to use the command-line interface `py7za-box` as well, make sure the dependencies for it are installed like this: 
```commandline
pip install py7za[box]
py7za-box --help
```

On Linux, you will have to have `p7zip` installed for `py7za` to work, as there is no Linux binary included in the package. For example:
```commandline
sudo yum install -y p7zip
sudo apt-get install -y p7zip
```

## Examples

With the package installed, try running this script:
```
from py7za import Py7za

# zip all .txt files in c:\temp and subdirectories to texts.zip
Py7za.run(r'a c:\temp\*.txt texts.zip -r')
```

A simple example use of `AsyncIOPool`, to run multiple copies of 7za in parallel:
```python
from py7za import AsyncIOPool, Py7za
from pathlib import Path
from asyncio import run

async def zip_many(root, glob, target='.'):
    async for task_result in AsyncIOPool(pool_size=4).arun_many(
            [Py7za(f'a {target}/{fn.name}.zip {fn}') for fn in Path(root).glob(glob)]):
        print(task_result.arguments, task_result.return_code)

run(zip_many('c:/documents', '*.bak', target='c:/temp'))
```
This function would find a bunch of files and create zip files for each in another location, with 4 copies of 7za running at any time, until it's done.

Note: 7za itself supports multicore compression when compressing multiple files into a single archive. So if you're compressing many files into a few archives, it may not be optimal to create a pool with as many tasks as you have cores.

### Command line py7za-box

To quickly replace every .csv file in a folder and in all its sub-folders with a zip-file containing that .csv:
```commandline
py7za-box **/*.csv
```

And the reverse:
```commandline
py7za-box **/*.csv.zip --unbox
```

A more elaborate example:
```commandline
py7za-box **/*.csv **/*.txt --root c:/temp --folders --output verbose -7 "-mx=9 -psecret" 
```

This would run `py7za-box` with `c:/temp` as the working directory (`--root c:/temp`), matching all .csv and .txt files in it and in its sub-folders (`**/*.csv **/*.txt`), printing the command line for each execution of 7za as it happens (`--output verbose`). Ensure that the sub-folder structure relative to `c:/temp` is preserved in the archives (`--folders`). Pass options to 7za (`-7 "-mx=9 -psecret"`) to ensure maximum compression (`-mx=9`) and set a password on the archive (`-psecret`, i.e. password will be 'secret').

### Structure and Folders

There is a clear distinction between the `--structure` and `--folders` options for `py7za-box`, which may not be immediately obvious.

Compare these sets of statements:
```commandline
py7za-box **/*.csv --structure 0 --folders 0 --target output
py7za-box **/*.csv --structure 1 --folders 0 --target output  # this is the default!
py7za-box **/*.csv --structure 0 --folders 1 --target output
```
All three will try and find all .csv files in the current folder (because no alternative `--root` was provided) and all sub-folders, and create individual archives for each.

The first will create all those archives directly in `output`, and the archives will only contain the .csv itself, no folder structure. So, if the current folder contains a file `files/data.csv`, an archive called `output/data.csv.zip` will be created, containing only `data.csv`.

The second will recreate the folder structure relative to the source folder, putting each archive in sub-folders created in `output`, but the archives will still only contain the .csv itself. Again, if the current folder contains a file `files/data.csv`, an archive called `output/files/data.csv.zip` will be created, containing only `data.csv`. This is the default and works most naturally when not providing a `--target`, but performing the archival in place, and deleting the originals, which is also the default.

The third will create all the archives directly in `output`, but the archives will contain the sub-folder structure as well as the .csv itself. Again, if the current folder contains a file `files/data.csv`, an archive called `output/data.csv.zip` will be created, containing `files/data.csv`.

Note that you could also set both `--structure` and `--folders` to be true, but that would create an archive `output/files/data.csv`, which would contain `files/data.csv`; when extracting the resulting files, care would need to be taken to avoid files ending up in double sub-folder structures, so a warning is issued if you combine these options.

Also note that `py7za-box **/*.csv --structure 0 --folders 1 --target output` is not the same as `7za.exe a output/archive.zip *.csv -r`. The latter creates a single archive, not one archive for each file, which is the purpose of `py7za-box`.  

## Common mistakes

### Folders that already have archives

If a folder already contains archives (.zip, .gz, etc.) and you run `py7za-box` using some filter that would (also) match these files, they will not get zipped again, unless you also provide the `zip_archives` option. However, if you then proceed to unzip all archives, these original archives may also be matched and unzipped. I.e.:
```commandline
py7za-box **/*                 # everything gets matched, but matched archives like .zip files will get ignored
py7za-box **/*.zip --unbox     # after this, if there were .zip files in the original folder, they will have been extracted

py7za-box **/* --zip_archives  # this option will get py7za-box to re-zip the archives
py7za-box **/*.zip --unbox     # after this, the folder will be identical to the original folder, with any archives
```

Based on the above, you might expect `--zip_archives` to be the default, after all it makes it easier to restore a folder to its original state. However, a more common use case is where a user boxes files in a folder, then proceeds to add new files, and then want to box these new files, without having to explicitly exclude the previously boxed files. For example:
```commandline
py7za-box **/*                 # box everything
copy newfile.txt .             # add some new content
py7za-box **/**                # box everything new (but leave the archives created before)
```

To make life a little easier, if an archive contains more than one file, it will not be extracted by `--unbox`. Since most existing archives likely contain more than one file, that means that in the first example above, only zip files that only contain a single file would be extracted by:
```commandline
py7za-box **/*.zip --unbox     # after this, if there were .zip files **with a single file in them ** 
                               # in the original folder, they will have been extracted
```

But of course there are cases where you use `py7za-box` to zip folders, which may contain multiple files, so you need some way to tell it to do that. For example:
```commandline
py7za-box **/sub-* --match_dir                # box directories starting with "sub-"
py7za-box **/sub-*.zip --unbox --unbox_multi  # unbox the resulting zip files, regardless of the number of files 
```

As with any major file operation, you will want to be careful, but hopefully the above helps making some common mistakes that can make a mess. `py7za` has been designed with defaults that keep the most common use cases in mind, but you can override those defaults as needed.

### Matching directories

Consider this command:
```commandline
py7za-box **/* --match_dir
```
Looks innocent, but note that this matches all files and folders it can find and will try to archive all of them. This almost certainly will lead to a folder being archived before its content, causing `py7za-box` to fail because after the folder is archived, the file can no longer be found and thus cannot be archived.

So, how about:
```commandline
py7za-box **/* --match_dir --match_file false
```
Better, but matched subdirectories can still cause the same problem. When using `--match_dir`, you should make sure there won't be matches inside matches. `py7za-box` does *not* currently offer a `--safe` option, though it may in the future (which could check for these situations before running). Typically this means you either only match directories that have names or match patterns where you know they won't be nested, or you do something like this:
```commandline
py7za-box */temp --match_dir --match_file false
```
This would match and directory named `temp` exactly one level from the current directory, so accidental nesting is impossible. However, it would of course miss `./dir1/dir2/temp` while `**/temp` would match both `./dir1/temp` and `./dir1/temp/temp`. There is no glob expression that allows you to only match the first or last occurrance. Similar to `--safe`, `py7za-box` currently does *not* have a `--regex_match` option where you could provide more powerful (but slower) matching, but may in future versions.

A final note on matching directories: unless you happen to know every directory you're matching only contains a single file, you should most likely pass `--unbox_multi` when unboxing archived directories, so that directories with multiple files also get unboxed corretly. However, not that this may also unzip multi-file archives that were present before boxing.

```commandline
py7za-box */* --match_dir --match_file false
py7za-box */*.7z --unbox --unbox_multi
```

### Matching groups of files

Some files are really only meaningful when they are available as a group. For example, an ArcGIS shape file `.shp` doesn't work correctly without its accompanying `.shx`, `.dbf`, etc. To help with this, `py7za-box ` automatically matches other files in a group if a single file is matched. For example, if you were to run this:
```commandline
py7za-box *.shp *.txt
```
It would proceed to box up all files in the current folder with the `.shp` suffix, but also any other files grouped with it. This doesn't affect other matches, so since `.txt` isn't a part of any group, those files still get matched normally. Also note that although files are boxed up together, they are still archived individually. The grouping doesn't put the files together in single archives, it just archives all of them individually.

Similarly, to unbox all shape files and their siblings, you would:
```commandline
py7za-box *.shp.7z --unbox
```
And `py7za-box` will match files in the group - as long as they have been boxed up using the same format (i.e. if you were to mix `.7z` and `.zip` when boxing them up for some reason, only the matching ones will be unboxed).

If you have additional groups that you want treated like this, you can provide them in .json format:
```json
{
  "my kind of files": [".ext1", ".ext2", ".etc"],
  "another kind of files": [".ext2", ".ext3", ".etc"]
}
```
Once you have a .json with your groups defined, you can get `py7za-box` apply them using:
```commandline
py7za-box *.ext1 -ga my_groups.json
```

Just be aware that you need to use unique keys and that reusing existing keys from `groups.json` would override them as well. Also, if multiple groups contain the same extension, the first group that has the extension of a matched file will be used. So in the above example, if you're matching `*.ext2` files, only matches in the first group would also be matched, but if you're matching `*.ext3`, only matches in the second group would also match. 

If you want to list predefined keys in `groups.json` from the package, you can run:
```commandline
type <path to your site-packages>\py7za\groups.json
```
(on Windows, use `cat` or an editor on Linux)

### Locked files

If you have files open in a program that locks the file for reading or writing, `py7za-box` may file to archive them, or remove them after archiving. A warning or error will be logged (and it's recommended you log to file with `--log_error <path>` for easy review). 

However, consider this scenario: a file is locked when archiving, so no file is archived and an error is logged. However, an (empty) archive is still created. From the presence of the archive (and ignoring the error log), you may falsely conclude that your file is safe and remove the original - you've just removed the only copy of the file!

If you notice these errors, simply close the program locking the files and rerun the boxing operation - under normal settings, it will proceed to box these files and ignore the other previously created archives.

## Dependencies

The only external dependency is on `conffu` for the configuration of the command-line tool. If you only want to use the Py7za class, and just use `pip install py7za`, this dependency won't be installed. To install the dependency, use `pip install py7za[box]`.
