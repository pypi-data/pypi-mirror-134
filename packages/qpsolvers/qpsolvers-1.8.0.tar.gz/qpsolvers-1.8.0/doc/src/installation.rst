Installation
************

Linux
=====

The simplest way to install the package on a recent Debian-based system with
Python 3 is:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt install python3-dev
    pip3 install qpsolvers

You can add the ``--user`` parameter for a user-only installation.

If you have an older system with Python 2, for instance Ubuntu 16.04, try:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt install python-dev
    pip qpsolvers==1.4.1

Python 2 is not supported any more, but this may still work. Note that
vulnerabilities `have been discovered
<https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers/pull/49>`_ in the dependencies of
this old version.

Windows
=======

- First, install the `Visual C++ Build Tools <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>`_
- Install your Python environment, for instance `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/>`_
- Open a terminal configured for Python, for instance from the Anaconda Navigator, and run:

.. code:: bash

    pip install qpsolvers

Solvers
=======

Open source solvers
-------------------

To install at once all QP solvers available from the `Python Package Index
<https://pypi.org/>`_, run the ``pip`` command with the optional
``all_pypi_solvers`` dependency:

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install "qpsolvers[all_pypi_solvers]"

This may take a while.

.. _gurobi-install:

Gurobi
------

Gurobi comes with a `one-line pip installation
<https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_linux/cs_using_pip_to_install_gr.html>`_
where you can fetch the solver directly from the company servers:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install -i https://pypi.gurobi.com gurobipy

This version comes with limitations. For instance, trying to solve a problem
with 200 optimization variables fails with the following warning:

.. code:: python

    Warning: Model too large for size-limited license; visit https://www.gurobi.com/free-trial for a full license

.. _qpoases-install:

qpOASES
-------

Check out the `official qpOASES installation page
<https://projects.coin-or.org/qpOASES/wiki/QpoasesInstallation>`_ for the
latest release. However, you might run into errors at the ``make python`` step.
If so, you can check out qpOASES from `this fork
<https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpOASES>`_ and follow these instructions:

.. code:: bash

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpOASES.git
    cd qpOASES
    make
    cd interfaces/python
    python setup.py install --user

The `setup.py` script takes the same command-line arguments as `pip`. Remove
`--user` and run it as root to install the library system-wide.
