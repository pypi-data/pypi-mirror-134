```sh
from scrape_google_results import *
response = google.search_result_scraper(Search="doctor")
#response = {
#  {
#  "body": [
#    {
#      "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, ...",
#      "title": "NIMH Â» Autism Spectrum Disorder"
#    }

```
