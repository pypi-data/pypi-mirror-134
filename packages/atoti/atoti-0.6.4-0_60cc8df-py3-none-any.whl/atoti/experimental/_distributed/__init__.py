Warning:
    Experimental features are subject to breaking changes (even removals) in minor and/or patch releases.

atoti supports distributed clusters with several data cubes and one query cube.

This is not the same as a query session: in a query session, the query cube connects to a remote data cube and query its content, while in a distributed setup, multiple data cubes can join a distributed cluster where a distributed cube can be queried to retrieve the union of their data.
