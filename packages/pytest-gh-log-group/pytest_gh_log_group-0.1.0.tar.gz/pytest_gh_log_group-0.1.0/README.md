### Usage

```
pip install pytest_gh_log_group
```

plugin name: `pytest_gh_log_group`

activated by env variable: `GITHUB_ACTIONS`. By default, GitHub action have this variable.


### NOTE

GitHub does not currently support nesting groups.

pytest prints outcome letters (.sxFE) by default, and it can't be turned off. 
This behaviour causes conflict with GitHub grouping functionality and this library 
not yet solve conflict perfectly. 
However, pytest can be customized in many ways, including the outcome printing which potentially solves this conflict.
