"""
This module is implementing the support for saving tissuumaps project files in Napari.
Specifically, the module implements all the hooks necessary for a writer plugin in
Napari.

It implements the ``napari_get_writer`` and ``napari_write_image`` hook specifications.
see: https://napari.org/docs/dev/plugins/hook_specifications.html

def napari_get_writer(path: str, layer_types: List[str]) -> Optional[_WriterFunction]:
    """Return function capable of writing napari layer data to ``path``.
    This function will be called whenever the user attempts to save multiple
    layers (e.g. via ``File -> Save Layers``, or
    :func:`~napari.plugins.io.save_layers`).
    This function must execute **quickly**, and should return ``None`` if
    ``path`` has an unrecognized extension for the reader plugin or the list of
    layer types are incompatible with what the plugin can write. If ``path`` is
    a recognized format, this function should return a *function* that accepts
    the same ``path``, and a list of tuples containing the data for each layer
    being saved in the form of ``(Layer.data, Layer._get_state(),
    Layer._type_string)``. The writer function should return a list of strings
    (the actual filepath(s) that were written).
    .. important::
        It is up to plugins to inspect and obey any extension in ``path``
        (and return ``None`` if it is an unsupported extension).
    An example function signature for a ``WriterFunction`` that might be
    returned by this hook specification is as follows:
    .. code-block:: python
        def writer_function(
            path: str, layer_data: List[Tuple[Any, Dict, str]]
        ) -> List[str]:
            ...
    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        Path to file, directory, or resource (like a URL).  Any extensions in
        the path should be examined and obeyed.  (i.e. if the plugin is
        incapable of returning a requested extension, it should return
        ``None``).
    layer_types : list of str
        List of layer types (e.g. "image", "labels") that will be provided to
        the writer function.
    Returns
    -------
    Callable or None
        A function that accepts the path, a list of layer_data (where
        layer_data is ``(data, meta, layer_type)``). If unable to write to the
        path or write the layer_data, must return ``None`` (not ``False``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str

    data : array or list of array
        Image data. Can be N dimensional. If meta['rgb'] is ``True`` then the

        True, then the data should be interpreted as a multiscale image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str

    data : array or list of array
        Integer valued label data. Can be N dimensional. Every pixel contains
