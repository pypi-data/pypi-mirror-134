Google Search Result Scraper is a python library to scrape for a google search result using browser automation. 
It currently runs only on windows.

## Scrape Search Results
We first import library, then we provide the keyword to be scraped instead of "doctor".
```sh
from google_search_result_scraper import *
response = google.search_result_scraper(Search="doctor")
```

### Response Data
```json
      "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, ...",
      "title": "NIMH Â» Autism Spectrum Disorder"
```

#### BotStudio
[Bot_Studio](https://pypi.org/project/bot_studio/) is needed for browser automation. As soon as this library is imported in code, automated browser will open up in which google web pages and searches the keyword which was given, and scrapes the data from the search results.
