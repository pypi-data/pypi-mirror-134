As mentioned, such rapid heating is achieved through the insertion of a micrometer-thick nickel sheet. The impact of this additional component on cell power density can be evaluated through Eq. 1, where m is the mass of the given cell and the ratio of discharge power evaluated through HPPC is inversely proportional to the ratio of DCRs(Power Density)SEB(Power Density)baseline@RT=(DCRbaseline@RTDCRSEB@60Â°C)(mbaselinemSEB)(1)
