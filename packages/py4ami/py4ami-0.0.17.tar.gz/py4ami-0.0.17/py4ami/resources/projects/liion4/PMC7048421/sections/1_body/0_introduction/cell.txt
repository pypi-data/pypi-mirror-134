To achieve the requisite stable, robust EEIs, the additive, triallyl phosphate (TAP), is used in this work based on sufficient evidence in the literature of its ability to improve cell stability at both high-voltage and high-temperature conditions. For example, in 2015, Xia et al. (2) demonstrated that a TAP-based electrolyte forms thick protective layers on both electrodes in graphite/NCM442-based cells as evidenced by reduced self-discharge at high temperatures, reduced gas production during high-temperature cycling, and increased Rct. Although TAP has been explored previously, it is chosen in the present work to create resistive Li-ion cells as an example to illustrate the concept of realizing high safety and high performance simultaneously. Other ways to build resistive cells, such as using electrode materials of low Brunauer-Emmett-Teller areas, are effective as well.
