Although TAP has been explored previously, it is chosen in the present work to create resistive Li-ion cells as an example to illustrate the concept of realizing high safety and high performance simultaneously. Other ways to build resistive cells, such as using electrode materials of low Brunauer-Emmett-Teller areas, are effective as well.
