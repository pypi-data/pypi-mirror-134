When high power is required, the SEB cells are to be heated internally (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>) and operated at elevated temperatures. Assuming the environmental temperature is 25&#176;C, and the SEB and baseline cells operate at 60&#176; and 30&#176;C, respectively, the SEB provides a temperature difference driving heat dissipation that is 7&#215; larger than the baseline case. Further, the SEB cell has lower DCR at its operational temperature of 60&#176;C (17.1 ohm&#183;cm<sup>2</sup> for SEB with 1 wt % TAP) than the baseline cell at 30&#176;C (25.3 ohm&#183;cm<sup>2</sup>), indicating ~1.5&#215; lower heat generation at the same current. The combination of these two factors eases the burden of thermal management by a factor of approximately 10 for SEB cells.</p>
