# README

pyCal2PDF is inspired by python module [Calendar](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html) which can generate either html or txt calendars with extra goal to generate:
* *.pdf Calendar
* fill calendar with information coming from iCalendar files (*.ics)
* easy configuration of different printing templates
