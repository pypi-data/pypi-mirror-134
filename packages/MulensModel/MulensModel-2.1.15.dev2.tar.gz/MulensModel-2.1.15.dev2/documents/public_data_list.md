## Public microlensing photometric datasets

The paper describing MulensModel ([Poleski & Yee 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26C....26...35P/abstract)) in Appendix B listed the public datasets available at the time. 

Public datasets published later:

* [9 yr of MOA survey data](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/MOAMission.html - MOA 9yr),
* [first WFIRST Data Challenge](https://github.com/microlensing-data-challenge/data-challenge-1) - currently it includes not only lightcurves but also assumed parameters.

We will try to add more datasets when they appear.
