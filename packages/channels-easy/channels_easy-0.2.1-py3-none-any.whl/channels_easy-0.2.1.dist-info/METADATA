channels-easy
============

A thin wrapper around channel consumers to make things **EASY**.

Installation
------------

To get the latest stable release from PyPi

```bash
pip install channels-easy
```
To get the latest commit from GitHub

```bash
pip install -e git+git://github.com/namantam1/channels-easy.git#egg=channels-easy
```
<!-- TODO: Describe further installation steps (edit / remove the examples below): -->

As `channels-easy` is a thin wrapper around `channels` so channels must be in your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

```bash
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...,
    'channels',
)
```

Usage
-----

All the naming convention used to implement this library is inspired from [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to make server implementation simple.

```python
# consumers.py
from channels_easy.generic import AsyncWebsocketConsumer


class NewConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        # join room on connect
        await self.join("room1")
        await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        # Leave room on disconnect
        await self.leave("room1")

    async def on_message(self, data):
        print("message from client", data)
        await self.emit("message", "room1", {"message": "hello from server"})

```
