# hellosetup :: A Python Package Example

This is a minimal starter project for a setuptools project.

This project is a companion to the [Python Package Example: Setuptools](https://codesolid.com/python-package-example-setuptools).

We're publishing it as a GitHub template, so you can easily [create your project from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

# Branches

* __main__: We've intentionally kept the default main branch as simple as possible.  The "more_features" branch This is absolutely bare-bones project, which we describe how to use in the article. 
* __more_features__: The more_features branch shows how to provide additional configuration to handle features beyond those which are strictly needed to get the project to publish.
