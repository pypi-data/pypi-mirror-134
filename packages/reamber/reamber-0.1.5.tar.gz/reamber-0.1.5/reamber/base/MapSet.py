        >>> m.offset *= 2

        >>> m.stack().lengths *= 2

        This will change the offsets of all lists that have the offset property.
        This will change the map itself, as stack is a reference

        This also is a "naive" system, so if the property, like column, doesn't exist
        for Bpms, it will not break it. However, all properties must exist at least
        once.

        If the property isn't listed here, you can do string indexing

        """ How does this work? 

        Firstly, if you concat a list of dfs, pd will always make a copy, so you have to 
        preserve the original dfs and also the stacked.

        LISTS ---STACK---> COPY ---> STACKED
          +---------- REFERENCE ---> UNSTACKED  

        The reason for stacking is so that we don't have to loop through all dfs to mutate.
        If we did loop through the dfs, we have to stack them anyways, so it's as efficient.
        However, it's just easier, by my eyes, to stack then attempt to mutate.

        So, we keep 2 things in check, the unstacked, and the stacked.

        However, we only can mutate the stacked one, then convert to the unstacked, because
        the unstacked is the referenced.

        Hence, we keep track of what partitions of the unstacked are each of the stacked.

        IXS        |         |          |    |     |
        UNSTACKED  [........] [........] [..] [....]
        STACKED    [...............................]

        That's where ixs come in to help in converting the stacked values to unstacked.

        So the workflow is that when we retrieve a value, it's always from the stacked.
        Then, when it's mutated, it can be set and it will always call the _update
        to update the referenced unstacked.
