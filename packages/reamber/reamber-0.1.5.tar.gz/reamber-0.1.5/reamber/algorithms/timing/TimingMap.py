        """ Given a list of denominators, it reduces the required amount of cells needed to fully hold them exactly

        Take for example, [1,3,6,7] with a limit of 10
        The best way to reduce it would be to use [6,7]. as we can represent 1, 3, 6 with 6 slots.

        The limit depicts the highest value it can be.

        The algorithm is simple, it loops through the whole list in a cartesian pair-wise and tries to combine pairs
        with LCM as long as it doesn't exceed the threshold.

        The return is a dictionary on the reduction. For example the above will yield
        {1: 6, 3: 6, 6: 6, 7: 7}
