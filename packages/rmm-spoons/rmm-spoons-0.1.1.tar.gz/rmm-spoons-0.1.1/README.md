# RMM: RimWorld Mod Manager

RMM is an open source RimWorld mod manager designed for Unix systems. RMM uses the SteamCMD binary to download mods.

## 1.0 Release

I'm currently working on preparing version 1.0 for release. The point release includes a major architectural overhaul, improvements in code quality, cross platform support, preliminary support for a QT based GUI, and early mod sorting. As of right now, versions below 1.0.0 are in maintenence mode. However, isssues will still be fixed as they are found.

## MOD DEVELOPERS PLEASE READ:

When using `rmm update`, rmm will update all mods in your game path and will overwrite your development folder with the latest version from Steam. To prevent all destructive writes, create a `.rmm_ignore` file in your Mods directory.

## Prerequisites

To use RMM you need:
- SteamCMD installed and in your path.
- [Optional] Set RMM_PATH to game path if game is installed in non default location.
  Alternative, you can use the `-p` flag to tell RMM where RimWorld is.

#### Install SteamCMD

1. A. For Arch Linux, you can install steamcmd using makepkg as stated below:
``` sh
mkdir -p ~/build ; cd ~/build
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/steamcmd.git
cd steamcmd
makepkg -si
```

1. B. Alternatively, you can install it using a 'AUR Helper' such as yay.
``` sh
yay -S steamcmd
```

2. Verify steamcmd is correctly installed:
``` sh
whereis steamcmd
```

Should return a path such as below. Otherwise check to make sure steamcmd is in your path.
``` sh
steamcmd: /usr/bin/steamcmd /usr/share/steamcmd
```

#### Adding .local/bin to your PATH

RMM can be directly accessed with command `rmm`. In order for this to work, you need to add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH variable, otherwise, your terminal will not find the `rmm` script. If you notice that you cannot run `rmm` after installation, try the following:
``` sh
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Alternatively, RMM can always be accessed by
``` sh
python -m rmm
```


#### Set RMM_PATH (Optional)

If RimWorld is installed a directory other than the default ones, you should set the RMM_PATH variable to your game directory for convenience.

Set it permanently in your `bashrc` or `zshrc` files:
``` sh
# Note please update this path to your actual game or mod directory
echo 'export RMM_PATH="$HOME/your/game/path" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Temporarily set it during your shell session:
``` sh
export RMM_PATH="~/PATHTOGAME/game/Mods"
```

#### Set RMM_WORKSHOP_PATH (Optional)

You probably do not need to set this variable.

RMM supports managing mods in your Steam Workshop mods directory. If RimWorld is installed into the same library as your Workshop mods, as would be the case for most people, RMM will find your workshop directory. Otherwise, you can set this value as per the example below:

``` sh
echo 'export RMM_WORKSHOP_PATH="$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/workshop" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Installng RMM from PyPi (Recommended)

``` sh
python3 -m pip install --user rmm-spoons
```


## Installation for Development (Developers)

Clone repository and install with pip.
```
mkdir -p ~/build
git clone https://github.com/Spoons/rmm.git ~/build/rmm
pip install --user ~/build/rmm
```
