# Bitvavo API (upgraded)

Hi, this is *not* the official API, but this one has:

- build-in documentation
- typing for *all* functions and classes
- unit tests (I already found three bugs that I fixed, because the original code wasn't tested, at all)
- a changelog, so you can track of the changes that I make
- compatible with Python 3.7 and newer ([3.6 isn't supported as of 2021-12-23](https://endoflife.date/python))
- a working version of `getRemainingLimit()`

Version `1.*` is guaranteed compatible\* with the original API.

\*: Except for `Bitvavo.candles`. I had to renamed the `symbol` argument to `market`, because the `candles` call actually excpects a `market`. So that's more of a bugfix.
\*\*: Same goes for `Bitvavo.book`; it had the same problem as `candles`.
