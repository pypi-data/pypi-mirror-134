Description
===========

Aggregation entities are required by the api consistency guidelines
for API Consistency Guidelines#AnalyticsAPIs.  These are used to
summarize annotations for a given dataset and will be used to populate
UI elements.  Aggregations need to have the fields that identify the
exact scope that theyâ€™re summarizing.  Any filters to the list API we
apply would have to show up in the aggregation. We should limit the
number of filters and dimensions as much as possible.


Available Commands
