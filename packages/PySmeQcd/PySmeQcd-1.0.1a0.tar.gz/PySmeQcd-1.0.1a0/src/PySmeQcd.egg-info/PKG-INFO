# PySmeQcd

**PySmeQcd** is a Python library for making calculations within the framework of
the Screened Massive Expansion of Quantum Chromodynamics.

Currently, PySmeQcd contains functions and routines related to the one-loop gluon,
ghost and quark propagators in any covariant gauge, both in
pure Yang-Mills theory and in full QCD.

## Features

- Compute the one-loop gluon, ghost and quark propagators in an arbitrary covariant gauge
- Plot the dressing functions, propagators, spectral functions, and more
- Find the poles and residues of the gluon and quark propagators
- Other features

## Installation

### Using ```pip```

PySmeQcd is available on PyPI. To install it, run

```console
$ pip install PySmeQcd
```

### From source

To use PySmeQcd from the source code:

1. Download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/GComitini/PySmeQcd/releases/download/v1.0.1-alpha/PySmeQcd-1.0.1a0.tar.gz).
