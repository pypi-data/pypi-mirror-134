Description: # dblpct
        
        The % in the string given as the first argument is doubled and output to stdout.  
        It's my hobby CLI tool.  
        
        ## install
        
        ```
        # pip install dblpct
        ```
        
        
        ## how to use
        
        ex1)
        ```
        # dblpct http://example.com/%E3%83%86%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88URL
        http://example.com/%%E3%%83%%86%%E3%%82%%B9%%E3%%83%%88URL
        ```
        
        ex2)
        ```
        # dblpct -r http://example.com/%%E3%%83%%86%%E3%%82%%B9%%E3%%83%%88URL
        http://example.com/%E3%83%86%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88URL
        ```
        
        `-r`  means `Reverse operation` of this tool.
        
        ex3)
        ```
         # dblpct -r $(dblpct %%)
        %%
        
         # dblpct $(dblpct -r %%)
        %%
        
         # dblpct $(dblpct %%)
        %%%%%%%%
        ```
        
        ## Caution
        
        Special characters in bash, etc. are not escaped.  
        They will be interpreted as a command line string when entered.  
        
        ex1)
        ```
         # dblpct FJWRF%)faw
        -bash: syntax error near unexpected token `)'
        ```
        
        If you want to enter special characters,  
        enclose them in quotes or escape them appropriately.  
        
        ex2)
        ```
         # dblpct 'fahj4(jfawe&%%fawle$kf'
        fahj4(jfawe&%%%%fawle$kf
        ```
