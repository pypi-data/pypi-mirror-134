#Python Client for Suprema GSDK

This is the pip distributable version of the Suprema GSDK Python client, which makes it easier to interact with the GSDK.

The examples from the [Suprema GSDK wiki][gsdkwiki] can be used, but with this package, all dependencies are handled via PIP.
The EventCode .json file and device list are also initialized automatically when importing package.

On some clients (Particularly android) the  EventCode json can sometimes not be loaded. If this happens, an error will display.
You can then call supremaPython.initCodeMap(JsonFileLocation)

To check Event codes, call supremaPython.getEventString(eventCode,subCode)
To check device type, call supremaPython.deviceType\[deviceCode\]

##How to use the rest of the classes.

All classes that can be used are imported under the biostarPython package.
The ones currently written are:
GatewayClient, 
ConnectSvc, 
DeviceSvc, 
FaceSvc, 
FingerSvc, 
StatusSvc, 
UserSvc,
DisplaySvc,
AdminSvc,
WiegandSvc,
TimeSvc,
CardSvc,
EventSvc,
NetworkSvc,
ServerSvc,
SystemSvc,
DoorSvc,
RS485Svc,

With the remaining being added in a future release.

With all of these services, they are a callable class underneath the biostarPython package. An example of initial setup with the GatewayClient and ConnectSvc is below:
For all of the functions below these services, they are formated with the first letter in lowercase, so to search a device would be searchDevice(), to get info would be getInfo().
The guides on how to use these are present at the the [Suprema GSDK wiki][gsdkwiki] 

import biostarPython as g
gateway = g.GatewayClient('127.0.0.1',4000,'ca.crt')
channel = gateway.getChannel()
connect = g.ConnectSvc(channel)
connect.searchDevice(300)
